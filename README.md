SlideRuler
==========
This is a small Android control when i am interviewing in Boohee.

As its name, it is a small slide ruler.

You can slide to get current chosed count.

It supports the different unit and background images.

Next step, i will change scroll viewer to horizontal listview to support over-scroll effect.

Horizontal listview supports over-scroll effect, it will much improve user exprerience.
